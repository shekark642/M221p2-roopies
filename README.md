# Welcome
This is the project of the one and only p2-slackbots and our project is called Cooler Math Games!

Main idea: Our website is the go-to place for gamers. All kinds of stuff relating to gaming, we got it! We implement information pages for gamers (or non-gamers) to look at to learn, and we also have real games for users to play. Come to this website for real time information, games you can play directly on the website, and redirection to real games. Have fun!
The games will be pulled in from an API, as well as personally customed by us.

Group members: [Justin](https://github.com/jli615), [Rohan](https://github.com/RohanKoshy), [Shekar](https://github.com/shekark642), [Abhijay](https://github.com/Dubshott), [Kian](https://github.com/Uhpachee)

## Week 2

**Release Day Policies**
Our policy is that everyone has to complete their assigned task and completed it before 6:00 pm on the due date. This will allow us to complete everything and make sure there are no problems within. 

Try to focus on completing the project at least a day before so that we can complete any other problems before the due date.
