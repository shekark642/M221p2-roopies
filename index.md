# Welcome

Project Idea:

This project can be the database and display screen of a smart mirror. This project can house the software of our smart mirror. We are going to display a website that produces this. We are going to use a high-resolution monitor and display a software website on it using java and data structures.

### Build Plan

**Materials Needed**

- LCD Screen of any size
- Piece of glass the same size as the display
- Raspery Pi

**Plan**

1. First we will seperate the actual display from the monitor and its bezel, this way it will just be a flat screen that we can put the glass on top.
2. Next put the glass which should be made the exact same size as the display on top of the display to add a mirror effect while the user can still see the screen image when its on.
3. Connect rasperry pi to the display and connect power to have a working digital mirror.
4. Add code/ui that adds a interactable aspect to the mirror instead of just information on a screen, also it would look really unprofessional without some sort of visual UI.
5. Present project to Mr. Mortensen after all code and databases have been completely connected and mirror server is deployed.
